				<h2>Who I am</h2>
			</header>
			<p>As a media and communications consultant, **I help people and organizations tell stories that stand out**. I specialize in leveraging social media, viral marketing, and visual storytelling to drive audience engagement and organizational growth. With the average American now being exposed to over 5,000 ads a day, you can’t afford to use a generic marketing approach anymore.</p>
			<p>As a freelance agent, I offer professional photography, videography, and graphic design services in the greater Quad City Area. I'm equipped to handle a wide range of media production needs. Whether you're looking for a logo design, senior portrait, or real estate drone video – just send me a message using the form below and I'll be happy to provide a quote.</p>
